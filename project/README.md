# Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter Data

This repository contains the code for the project *Sentiment Analysis Using Twitter Data: A Comparative Application of Lexicon and Machine Learning-based Approaches*. The project analyzes sentiment from Twitter data using two primary methods:

- **Lexicon-based Approach**: Analyzing sentiment by leveraging predefined sentiment lexicons.
- **Machine Learning-based Approach**: Using supervised classifiers to determine sentiment based on labeled training data.

## Project Features

1. **Data Cleaning.ipynb**: Basic data cleaning steps and data statistics.
2. **Further Cleaning and Lexicon-based Method.ipynb**: Tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, and implementation of three lexicon-based approaches.
3. **Initial Data Analysis.ipynb**: Word cloud generation and word frequency analysis.
4. **Data Analysis for Lexicon-based Methods.ipynb**: Statistics for each city, stage, and method with data analysis and visualizations.
5. **Supervised Approaches.ipynb**: Implementation of supervised classifiers with evaluation.
