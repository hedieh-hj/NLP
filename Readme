# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects Repository

This repository contains various projects focused on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. The projects showcase different aspects of NLP, from basic tasks like calculating bigram probabilities to more complex techniques such as **lexicon-based sentiment analysis**.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Bigram Probability Calculation**
   - This project focuses on calculating the probability of bigrams (pairs of consecutive words) in a given corpus. It demonstrates how to compute the frequency of word pairs and estimate the probability of a word pair occurring, which is fundamental for language modeling and text prediction.

### 2. **Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis**
   - This project implements a **lexicon-based sentiment analysis** approach, where the sentiment of a given text (positive, negative, or neutral) is determined by analyzing the words and phrases based on predefined lexicons. It helps in understanding the emotional tone of the text without requiring machine learning algorithms.

### 3. **Sentiment Analysis with Additional Techniques** *(Future work)*
   - We aim to extend the sentiment analysis project with machine learning techniques to improve accuracy and handle more complex scenarios, such as context-based sentiment evaluation.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Other NLP libraries

## Requirements

To run these projects, you will need to install dependencies.
